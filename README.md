# Early prediction of fault prone code using analytics
Identify the fault lines of your source base by making use of a 'Time- weighted Risk Analysis' algorithm.

It makes use of analytics to identify the code in your source base which contributes to bug the most.
See http://woki/display/~anils/Early+prediction+of+fault+prone+code+using+analytics for approach and more context.

## How does it work?
This is still in beta. Initial analysis was done on 'Care Pathways' projects and results have been published at:
